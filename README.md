# Momentum-Wheel-Project
Project to create a self balancing camera using momentum wheels. Goal is to suspend camera on support beam to secure z position,
then use momentum wheels to stabalize the camera in the x and y directions.

Background
The CubeSat program is used to send satellites into space with a size of 10 cm × 10 cm × 11.35 cm cubic units, and with a mass of less than 1.33 kilograms per unit. This satellites are used for basic research purposes, and often contain camera systems. In order to stablize these cameras, they use a momentum wheel for each axis. Our goal is to replicate this practice in two dimensions on earth.

Hardware Used
Arduino Microcontroller
12" knitting needle
4.4:1 Metal Gearmotor 25Dx48L mm MP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder
3-D Printed mountings for motor
Laser cut momentum wheels
